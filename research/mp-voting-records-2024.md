## Key House of Commons Votes & Labour Rebellions

### 1. Two-Child Benefit Cap Amendment (July 23-24, 2024)

During the King's Speech debate, the SNP tabled an amendment to abolish the two-child benefit cap on Universal Credit. Labour whip instructed MPs to vote against.

**Result:** Government defeated the amendment.

**7 Labour MPs defied the whip and had whip suspended:**
1. Richard Burgon (Leeds East)
2. Zarah Sultana (Coventry South)
3. John McDonnell (Hayes and Harlington)
4. Apsana Begum (Poplar and Limehouse)
5. Imran Hussain (Bradford East)
6. Rebecca Long-Bailey (Salford)
7. Ian Lavery (Blyth and Ashington)

All were Socialist Campaign Group (SCG) members. Whip later restored.

### 2. Winter Fuel Payment Vote (September 10, 2024)

Chancellor Reeves announced means-testing Winter Fuel Payments (worth up to £300/pensioner household), restricting them to Pension Credit recipients. Removed payment from ~10 million pensioners, citing £22bn "black hole" in public finances.

**Conservative Opposition Day motion demanding reversal.**
**Result:** Government won ~348 to ~228 (majority ~120, well below normal 174).

**Labour rebels:**
- 1 voted against: Jon Trickett (Hemsworth)
- ~52 Labour MPs did not vote (many deliberate abstentions)

**Notable Labour abstainers:**
- Rachael Maskell (York Central)
- Diane Abbott (Hackney North and Stoke Newington)
- John McDonnell (Hayes and Harlington)
- Several SCG-aligned and constituency-pressured MPs

This was deeply unpopular (70-80% public opposition) and contributed to Labour's rapid decline in polls from autumn 2024.

### 3. Autumn Budget 2024 (October 30, 2024)

Rachel Reeves delivered the largest tax-raising budget since 1993.

**Key measures:**
| Measure | Detail | Revenue (£bn/yr) |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Employer NI rise | 13.8% → 15%; threshold £9,100 → £5,000 | ~25 |
| Capital Gains Tax | Lower: 10% → 18%; Higher: 20% → 24% | ~2.5 |
| IHT Agricultural/Business Relief | 100% relief only on first £1m | ~1.8 |
| Non-dom abolition | Replaced with 4-year residence system | ~2.7 |
| Stamp Duty surcharge | 3% → 5% on additional properties | ~0.3 |
| VAT on private schools | 20% VAT from January 2025 | ~1.5 |
| Fiscal rules change | Debt metric → PSNFL | ~£50bn headroom |

**Total tax-raising package:** ~£40 billion

**Finance Bill Second Reading:** Passed without significant Labour rebellion. Budget was broadly supported within PLP because:
- Raised substantial revenue for public services (especially NHS +£22.6bn)
- Employer NI framed as not breaking manifesto pledge (which applied to employee NI)
- Seen as fiscally responsible with OBR costing

**Market reaction:** Relatively muted. Gilt yields rose ~ 10-15bp (within normal range). No crisis.

### 4. Employment Rights Bill (Introduced October 10, 2024)

Key provisions: day-one unfair dismissal rights, ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts, end to fire-and-rehire, strengthened union rights.

**Second Reading:** Passed late October 2024 without Labour rebellion. Popular across Labour, including union wing and soft left.

### 5. Assisted Dying Bill (November 29, 2024)

Kim Leadbeater's Private Members' Bill for terminally ill adults (6-month prognosis).

**Free vote** (no party whip): Passed **330 to 275** (majority 55).
- Starmer voted for
- Cabinet split: Streeting, Mahmood voted against

## Rebellion Pattern Summary

The pattern shows: SCG rebels regularly but is too small (~15-20 MPs) to defeat legislation. The soft left abstains as a warning signal. The "danger zone" for the government is reached only when a rebellion crosses factional lines (reaching 60+ MPs from across soft left, union wing, and Blue Labour simultaneously). With a 174-seat majority, 88 Labour rebels are needed to overturn the majority.
